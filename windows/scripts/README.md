## Where do these scripts go?
These should go in
`%USERPROFILE%/scripts`

## git.cmd
The `git.cmd` script is to use the git from WSL globally
1. Make sure you have Ubuntu installed from Microsoft Store
2. Add `%USERPROFILE%/scripts` to your PATH
3. Add `%USERPROFILE%/scripts/git.cmd` to the `Git executable` field in IntelliJ

Congrats, you have git without git for bash~
